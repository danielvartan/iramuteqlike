## Overview

`iramuteqlike` is an R package with tools to reproduce the [IRaMuTeQ](http://www.iramuteq.org/) software analyses in R. The aim of `iramuteqlike` is to facilitate text analyses and to improve reproducibility in research.

The package use different methods to compute some analyses, hence, the results can differ from the [IRaMuTeQ](http://www.iramuteq.org/) software.

Please note that `iramuteqlike` is not related in any way with the [IRaMuTeQ](http://www.iramuteq.org/) developer team.

## Prerequisites

You need to have some familiarity with the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/) to use `iramuteqlike` main functions.

If you don't feel comfortable with R, we strongly recommend checking Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund free and online book [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) and the Coursera course from John Hopkins University [Data Science: Foundations using R](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-foundations-r) (free for audit students).

## Installation

You can install `iramuteqlike` with:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("giperbio/iramuteqlike")
```

## Citation

If you use `iramuteqlike` in your research, please consider citing it. We put a lot of work to build and maintain a free and open-source R package. You can find the `iramuteqlike` citation below.
